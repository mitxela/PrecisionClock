# Precision Clock
Code for the ATtiny85 used in my [Precision Clock (Mk I)](https://mitxela.com/projects/precision_clock). Uses a DS1302 for timekeeping and MAX7219 chips for driving the LED 7-segment displays. I'm uploading this a while after writing it, I believe I must have taken the DS1302 SPI code from somewhere else since it's obviously written in a different style.
